## Sujets

Voilà une liste de sujets qui peuvent apparaître durant les conseils.

• ⁠Two or more civilizations are in disagreements with the Citadel's Speakers over the Clavigers for their Concord Jewels. The civilizations believe that Clavigers should only be hired from people who have lived in the home worlds, while the Speakers prefer to hire from "more trusted" citizens of the Citadel itself, some of whom have never lived in the worlds to which they travel to and from. This has opened some diplomatic disputes between leaders of the home worlds and their own representatives in the Citadel.

• ⁠One of the Concord Jewels has been irregular with its trips to and from its home world due to negligence/sabotage (see above) and thus has created a trade "traffic jam." Warehouses in the Citadel are packed full as more goods are brought in from World A, but World B's Jewel isn't removing them fast enough. Things are rotting/spoiling, and maybe some people have begun to skim some off the top.

• ⁠Magic users from __________ have started selling magical headbands/hats/helmets on the black market that prevent the guards and mages at the Passage of Respite from reading their minds at a glance, allowing for some quiet criminals to enter the Citadel undetected.

• ⁠In one area of the House of Convalescence, small pieces of the Auroral Diamond have begun to slough off the walls. This is bizarre, as the Diamond is, well, diamond, and indestructible. Why is this happening? In addition, an acolyte in the House may try to sell the shards, claiming them to contain the Auroral Diamond's power (they don't.)

• ⁠The Keening Gloom is getting closer every day, and some people don't believe that Sholeh and the other Speakers aren't acting quickly enough. People worry about having to return to their home worlds, some never having been there in their life, while  young folk in the Citadel are preparing a Y2K-type doomsday campaign, that Sholeh wants to quell if possible.

• ⁠The Sapphire Wyvern is dead and corrupted -- some people in the Court of Whispers are blaming certain civilizations for having conspired to sabotage another... though one sage who studies the Keening Gloom swears she spotted a sapphire Concord Jewel floating through the cyclone...

• ⁠A peppy young Shieldbearer who has aspirations of becoming a Speaker of the Ancestors is coming into conflict with Arayat. Arayat believes that the non-violent approach of the Shieldbearers is shortsighted and not aggressive enough to tackle the very real dangers facing some civilizations and that not taking sides allows oppression to flourish. Meanwhile this peppy upstart almost unilaterally sides with the Dawn Incarnates and the current Speakers-- no initiating violence and no taking sides in political conflicts in homeworlds. The Shieldbearers are being pressured to take a side in the debate.

• ⁠San Citlán has begun to manufacture prototypes for firearms and is selling them to other, less technologically advanced civilizations for high profits. The new technology runs the risk of destabilizing political climates and fast-tracking conflicts in certain areas.
